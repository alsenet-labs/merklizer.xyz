## Build

You can build the static webpages in a docker container with
```
env NODE_VERSION=v10 make  # NB: the remote repository will be used for the build
```
Then you can bind or copy the dist directory somewhere, on linux it is located at
```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/merklizer.xyz/_data/dist
```
And you can update them with eg:
```
git rm docs/js/*
sudo rsync -a /var/lib/docker/volumes/merklizer.xyz/_data/dist/ docs/
sudo chown $USER.$USER docs -R
```
On the other hand you can build the static webpages on your host from the local repository, at your risks and perils:
```
make unsafe-build
```
Then you can start the local build with:
```
gulp
```

## Clean
When you are finished, you can remove the docker container with eg
```
docker rm merklizer.xyz
```
or the associated docker volume with
```
docker volume rm merklizer.xyz
```

Check the docker documentation for more.

## Work in the container (git, gulp...)
### Restart the container with eg
```
docker start merklizer.xyz
```
### Run a shell in the container with eg
```
docker exec -it merklizer.xyz /bin/bash -l
```
or eg
```
docker exec -it merklizer.xyz /bin/bash -l -e 'screen -s /bin/bash'
```

#### Update gh-pages
eg after rebuilding the container, with:
```
docker start merklizer.xyz -ai << EOF
cd /home/nodejs/src/merklizer.xyz
git config user.name "$(git config user.name)"
git config user.email "$(git config user.email)"
git add docs
git commit docs -m "update gh-pages"
git push origin master
EOF
```

### Run and test web application with eg
```
docker start merklizer.xyz -ai << EOF
cd /home/nodejs/src/merklizer.xyz
gulp
EOF
```
